I am a life-long technologist and senior product manager who enjoys solving creative problems through technology. I'm passionate about nature & environmentalism, art & philosophy, technology and our relationship with it, and its impact on society. 

This site is where I collect those learnings and thoughts and throw them into the aether to clear my brain.
